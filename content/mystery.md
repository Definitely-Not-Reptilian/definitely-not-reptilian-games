What is a mystery night?

Each pack contains all the material you will need to run a one evening (2-4 hours) mystery and intrigue whodunnit event. Each player is handed out a unique character sheet, who has things they want, things they have and secrets they cannot afford to tell. By the end of the night, players will have stolen, killed, bluffed and negotiated with each other to get what they want! One player should read the whole pack and act as a game master for the night, making sure things run to schedule.

These packs are inspired by those created by [Free Form Games](https://www.freeformgames.com).

The packs below are free to print and use. Try them out now!

#### Not here to wed spiders
This Bogan (Australian) themed wedding is rudely interupted by the bride and groom announcing they can no longer get married. It is up to a haphazardous cast of hick's and drunken attendees to set the ceremony back on track before time runs out.
