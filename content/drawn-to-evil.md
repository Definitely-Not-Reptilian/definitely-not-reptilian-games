Drawn To Evil is a Tabletop RPG where you take on the role of an INVESTIGATOR, trying to track down and deal with an unknown Lovecraftian Evil. The game has no dice, and no character sheets. Instead players craft their characters using a deck of cards, and change the deck over time as their character changes and grows.

Up to four friends take on the role of supernatural horror INVESTIGATORS. One person takes on the role of the GAME MASTER who controls a destructive Evil monster, its minions, and innocent bystanders.

Similar to role-playing games like Apocalypse World, DRAWN TO EVIL unfolds a gripping narrative during gameplay, crafted collaboratively at the table. Players utilize deck-building mechanics to strengthen their INVESTIGATORS, while the GAME MASTER employs a unique set of cards to sow chaos and insanity.

Setup is engaging and quick, with games ready in minutes, ensuring every session delivers nail-biting tension. The perfect one-shot system for players new to RPGs and great fast paced punchy action for the experienced.

Players make a deck of cards that represent their character including personality traits, equipment, background and abilities. They then draw from their deck to determine the outcome of their actions.

The Game Master also has a set of cards that represent important characters and locations in the world. Importantly, these archetypes dictate the type of Evil that the players will investigate as well as any help or hinderance they find along the way.
