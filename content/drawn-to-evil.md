Take on the role of an investigator in a horror filled one session story whilst one of your friends takes on the role of the Game Master, who controls a destructive Evil monster, their minions and innocent bystanders.

Similiar to role playing games like Apocolypse World, where the story unfolds throughout play, Drawn to Evil allows a nail biting story to be told by everyone at the table. Combining deck building mechanics to build your player's characters, and a set of Game Master cards to inflict harm and insanity upon them, a game can be setup in mere minutes.

You can check out the [rules](/drawn-to-evil-rules) right now to learn how to play. Sign up to our mailing list to get access to the game as soon as possible!

Players make a deck of cards that represent their character including personality traits, equipment, background and abilities. They then draw from their deck to determine the outcome of their actions.

The Game Master also has a set of cards that represent important characters and locations in the world. Importantly, these archetypes dictate the type of Evil that the players will investigate as well as any help or hinderance they find along the way.
