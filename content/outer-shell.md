## Prototype

A text command-line version was prototyped in JS.

Outer shell is an ASCII art inspired 2D space exploration game. You pilot a space craft via a series of typed commands. Explore a randomly generated galaxy, fighting enemies and collecting loot. As you progress you will find ways to automate these commands through self written macros, enabling you to put your programming skills to the test and survive the dangers of space.

You can play the prototype in your browser here.
