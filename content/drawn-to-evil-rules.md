# Intro

Drawn to evil is a tabletop role playing game designed for 2-5 players. Players take on the role of an investigator in a horror filled one session story. One player takes on the role of the Game Master, who controls the Evil, their minions and innocent bystanders.

The exact choice of Evil, setting and play style is up to the Game Master and players but Drawn to Evil typically suits a modern setting with lovecraftian horror elements mixed in.

# Objective

The investigators must find the source of Evil, discover it's weakness and then end it for good. This may not require killing the Evil, simply locking it away, preventing it from being summoned, or generally 'stopping' it will often be enough. Sometimes, killing Evil wont be enough. The investigators may have to salt and burn the earth so no Evil can grow again.

As a Game Master it is your job to make the world, story and non player characters come alive. 

# Setup

Divide the cards into piles by type and shuffle the piles. Below are all of the card types.

# Player

There are things out there.\
Things that crawl, things that ooze, things that find places to hide. Sometimes it's a dark corner of a city, sometimes a remote desert tomb, harder yet when it has wriggled it's way into an innocent's mind.\
That's where you come in.\
You are an investigator: a specialist in the paranormal.\
Most aren't even aware of the otherworldly forces eager to devour and mutate our existence. It is a well kept secret, and you intend to keep it that way.\
How?\
Root it out and destroy it.\
No matter the horrors that lurch forth from the bowels of the universe, you will hunt it. As a team of hunters you are drawn to these forces and you will restore order.

## Character Creation

#### Step 1 - Standard Investigator Deck:
Each player begins by constructing a standard Investigator deck containing 10 ![Base](/img/drawn-to-evil/base.png) Base cards:

- 2 x Understanding
- 2 x Devotion
- 2 x Pleasure
- 2 x Rest
- 2 x Resolve

#### Step 2 - Customisation:
Then each player performs the following steps to customise their investigator:

- Draw 2 x each of ![Background](/img/drawn-to-evil/background.png) Background, ![Trait](/img/drawn-to-evil/trait.png) Trait and ![Role](/img/drawn-to-evil/role.png) Role cards. Keep 1 of each. Think about the combination that you think would fight Evil best.
- Draw 4 x ![Ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/ability.png) Ability cards. Keep 2. Think about the kind of moves your investigator would have.

#### Step 3 - Perform "Add to deck" instructions:

- Complete any ![Add to deck](/img/drawn-to-evil/add.png) Add to deck instructions on your Background and Trait cards (these are the instructions at the bottom of the cards). This may require you to remove base ![Base](/img/drawn-to-evil/base.png) cards to your starting deck answer a question about your past.

#### Step 4 - Construct tableau:
- Your ![Ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/ability.png) Ability cards and ![Role](/img/drawn-to-evil/role.png) Role card start in your tableau (layed out in front of you) ready to be used.

#### Step 5 - Construct deck:
- All other cards including your ![Background](/img/drawn-to-evil/background.png) Background and ![Trait](/img/drawn-to-evil/trait.png) Trait cards are shuffled together to form your deck.

#### Step 6 - Name:
- Give your investigator a name! Think about the name that sums up who you have constructed from the earlier steps.

#### Step 7 - Construct the upgrade deck:
- Once every player is done, shuffle the ![Item](/img/drawn-to-evil/item.png) Item and ![Ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/ability.png) Ability cards into one deck and place it face down in reach of all players.


### 4-5 player variant
If you are playing with 4 or 5 players (excluding the Game Master), instead start with the following:

- 1 x Understanding
- 1 x Devotion
- 1 x Pleasure
- 1 x Rest
- 1 x Resolve

Follow the remaining steps as usual.

## How to play

Most of your actions should be decided by describing what you wish to do (in character if possible) and the Game Master will tell you the result of your actions. \
When you attempt to do something dangerous, difficult or with a chance of failure, name an appropriate Basic Move or Ability card in your tableau. The Game Master will tell you if that is appropriate and get you to make a "Check" to see how successful your action is.

#### Zones:
Your cards exist in 3 main zones. Your deck, discard pile, and your tableau. You deck is face down, and your discard and tableau are face up.

#### Basic moves:

There are 6 Basic moves which the Game Master can ask you to perform. Refer to the reference cards for more information.

- **Puzzle Things Out** - Used to solve mysteries and think logically.
- **Read A Person** - Used to interact with people and get what you want from them.
- **Act Under Pressure** - Used to deal with dangerous situations, like withstanding poison, jumping out the way of a falling building or keeping your hands steady whilst defusing a bomb.
- **Take Control** - Used to smash, wrestle or shoot.
- **Deal With the Unknown** - Understand ancient runes, use psychic powers or just generally be magical.
- **Help** - Assist another player or NPC in completing their task.

*Note: Depending on the level of success, players might have a list of questions to ask the Game Master. These questions should always be answered honestly.*

#### Abilities:
Instead of using the basic moves, you can also use the abilities in your tableau. Once the Ability cards are used, they should go in your discard. You can use these abilities at any time.
Some Abilities allow you to use different Aspects when Checking. You can decide to use these abilities even after drawing the check cards, effectively turning your failure into a success by using a different total on the same cards.

#### Checking:
When using a move that requires you to 'Check' an aspect, draw cards from the top of your deck until you see 2 ![Stop](/img/drawn-to-evil/stop.png) Stop symbols. Then add up the total for the appropriate aspect (from on the coloured circle on the left) on all cards drawn and compare to the conditions of the move. Once the check is complete, place the cards from the check in the discard.\
When you are Checking, you might: 
- Draw an ![Ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/ability.png) Ability card. Put it in you tableau.\
- Draw a card with a ![Play card](/img/drawn-to-evil/play.png) Play Card rule on it. You should follow the instructions immediately.
- Draw 3 or more cards marked with a skull ![Skull](/img/drawn-to-evil/skull.png). Something bad happens. Refer to the [Death](#death) section of the rules for this.

**On any check when you total -1 or less:**\
You fail! The Game Master may give you an ![Injury](/img/drawn-to-evil/injury.png) Injury or ![Shock](/img/drawn-to-evil/shock.png) Shock card to add to your deck.
However your experience does embolden you and you may draw 2 cards from the combined ![Item](/img/drawn-to-evil/item.png) Item and ![Ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/ability.png) Abilities deck. Choose one and put it into your discard, return the other to the bottom of the deck.

#### Running out of cards:
Whenever your deck is empty, even in the middle of a check, shuffle all cards in your discard pile and they becomes your new deck.

# Game Master

You are the Game Master. In a world of unknown horrors seeking to change the very fabric of human existence, you are the secret agent pushing the world to the brink of catastrophe.

An Evil is the core to this. It drives the danger and is the cause for the entire event. Through the course of its actions and influences it will bring harm, corruption, destruction and suffering. The exact nature of it' plan will evolve as the story does but it never hurts to have some dastardly ideas in mind.

#### Step 1 - Evil:

The Evil is the focus of the story. Stopping it for good will end the story. 

- Draw 1 x Evil ![Evil](/img/drawn-to-evil/evil-icon.png) card.
- Give it a name.
- Decide what it wants and what that means for the players and the world if the Evil succeeds.
- Choose a weakness for the Evil so that the players can defeat it for good.
    - If they do not properly exploit the Evil's weakness then it will come back.
    - Weaknesses should not be "hates being stabbed". It should be something unique and specific to the Evil. (Eg. Vampires being staked to the ground by wood, or aliens being allergic to copper.)

![Monster Example](/img/drawn-to-evil/evil.png)

#### Step 2 - Minions:

A minion is an individual or group that will assist the Evil. 

- Draw 1 x Minion ![Minion](/img/drawn-to-evil/minion-icon.png) card.
- Give the minion(s) a name.
- Think about how and why they are helping the Evil.

Repeat this step for additional minions. (optional)

![Minion Example](/img/drawn-to-evil/minion.png)

#### Step 3 - Bystanders:

A bystander that will help the investigators in a variety of ways. It is important the players have allies as well as enemies.

- Draw 1 x Bystander ![Bystander](/img/drawn-to-evil/bystander-icon.png) card
- Give the bystander a name.
- Think about why they are helping the players and how the Evil has effected them.

Repeat this step for additional bystanders. (optional)

![Bystander Example](/img/drawn-to-evil/bystander.png)

#### Step 4 - Locations:

A location is somewhere that is important to the Evil and/or the story.

- Draw 1 x Location ![Location](/img/drawn-to-evil/location-icon.png) card
- Give the location a name.
- This may be a lair or where something the Evil wants resides. It can even be it's own entity trying to stop the players.

Repeat this step for additional locations, this can be done any time the player's visit a new hostile location.

![Location Example](/img/drawn-to-evil/location.png)

#### Step 5 - Player Introductions:

- Get each player in turn to:
- Tell you their name.
- Read and complete the ![Add to deck](/img/drawn-to-evil/add.png) prompts on their Background ![Background](/img/drawn-to-evil/background.png) and Trait ![Trait](/img/drawn-to-evil/trait.png) cards. Usually these ask the player to describe an event in the investigators past.

Then:
- Get all the players to collectively explain how they became a team of investigators.

As a Game Master you should attempt to integrate the player characters introductions into the story, changing locations, ideas and threats to tie them in whenever possible.

#### Step 6 - Gameplay

You are ready to begin!

Below are some principles to follow as a Game Master,

- Set the scene, it's often good to give the players a direct hook such as a call to arms, or even put them right into the aftermath of the Evil's latest attack.
- Ensure the players are given a clear path to discovering the Evil's weakness. If they never learn it, then the ending can be unsatisfying.
- Remember to ask the players "What do you do?"
- There is no turn order, but you should try to make sure everyone is being included in the action regularly. It is more fun that way, and if a player never does checks, they lose the ability to upgrade and never get some of their abilities on the tableau.
- This game is meant to play more like a narrative story than a numeric RPG. Nothing has hit points or stats to beat. If you feel a creature has been hurt enough then it is dead.
- Don't think about it as the players vs the NPCs. Think about the game as the players vs the entire world.
- If a player asks to do something very hard, instead of asking them to complete a difficult check tell them no. Maybe hint at them to break the task up into more manageable sub tasks.

#### Step 7 - Twist
When the players have confronted the Evil, and it looks like they will succeed it is time for a twist. The Evil should have one last trick up their sleeve that throws everything into peril. You may have an idea of this strategy when creating the Evil or it may appear naturally as a matter of circumstances. The best twists are foreshadowed early within the play session.

#### Step 8 - Epilogue

When the Evil is dealt with for good, or the investigators have failed gameplay stops. As Game Master you should describe the immediate outcome and then ask each player to provide an epilogue for their investigator; alive or dead.

# Reference

### Aspects

- **Reason** - Your ability to solve puzzles, detect a logical pattern or understand a complex idea.
- **Weird** - Your ability to be in tune with the supernatural or insane.
- **Passion** - Your ability to empathise, manipulate and convince others.
- **Soul** - Your ability to stay calm under pressure and resist the influence.
- **Might** - Your ability to exert control over the physical world.

### Zones

- **Investigator deck** - Most cards begin here; this is where you draw from when performing a check.
- **Tableau** - Cards on the table in front of you form your ready to use abilities. 
- **Discard pile** - After a card is drawn for a check or an Ability card is used, they are placed here face up. When your deck runs out of cards, shuffle your discard pile and these cards become your new investigator deck.

### Symbols
- ![Add to deck](/img/drawn-to-evil/add.png) Complete this effect when adding this card to your deck.
- ![Play card](/img/drawn-to-evil/play.png) Complete this effect each time you draw this card from your deck.
- ![Use ability](/img/drawn-to-evil/use.png) When a card with this symbol is in your tableau, you may use it anytime and complete its instructions. Afterwards put the card into your discard.
- ![Stop](/img/drawn-to-evil/stop.png) Drawing 2 of these symbols when performing a check means you should stop drawing cards.
- ![Skull](/img/drawn-to-evil/skull.png) Drawing 3 of these symbols in a single check indicates impending death or insanity!

### Death
If 3 or more Injury and/or Shock cards are drawn during a single check, that investigator is marked for death. Injury and Shock cards are marked with a ![Skull](/img/drawn-to-evil/skull.png).
Before the end of the session, all investigators marked must perish. It is up to the Game Master and player to decide how exactly their death or insanity manifests.
