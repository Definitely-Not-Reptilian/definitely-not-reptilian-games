# Intro

Drawn to evil is a tabletop role playing game designed for 2-5 players. Players take on the role of an investigator in a horror filled one session story. One player takes on the role of the Game Master, who controls the Evil, their minions and innocent bystanders.

The exact choice of Evil, setting and playstyle is up to the Game Master and players but Drawn to Evil typically suits a modern setting with lovecraftian horror elements mixed in.

# Objective

The investigators must discover the Evil and it's weakness to then end it for good. This may not require killing the Evil, simply locking it away, preventing it from being summoned, or generally 'stopping' it will often be enough.

As a Game Master it is your job to make the world, story and non player characters come alive. 

# Setup

Divide the cards into piles by type and shuffle them. Below are all of the card types.

- 50 x Base cards
- 12 x Background cards
- 12 x Trait cards
- Ability cards
- Item cards
- Injury cards
- Shock cards
- Bless cards
- 12 x Evil cards
- 10 x Minion cards
- 10 x Bystander cards
- 10 x Location cards

# Player

There are things out there.

Things that crawl, things that ooze, things that find places to hide. Sometimes it's a dark corner of a city, sometimes a remote desert tomb, harder yet when it hass wriggled it's way into an innocent's mind.

That's where you come in.

You are a hunter.

Most people aren't even aware of the paranormal. The otherworldly forces eager to devour and mutate our human existence are a secret, and you intend to keep it that way.

How?

Root it out and destroy it.

No matter the horrors that lurch forth from the bowels of the universe, you will hunt it. As a team of hunters you are drawn to these forces and you will restore order.

## Getting started

Each player begins by constructing a standard Player deck containing:

- 2 x Understanding
- 2 x Devotion
- 2 x Pleasure
- 2 x Rest
- 2 x Resolve

![Starting Deck](/img/drawn-to-evil/starting-deck.png)

Then each player performs the following steps to customise their character.

- Draw 2 each of Background cards and Trait cards. Keep 1 of each.
- Draw 4 Ability cards. Keep 2.
- Give your character a name!
- Follow any "Add to your deck" instructions on your Background and Trait cards.
- Your Ability cards start in your tableau ready to be used.
- Your Background and Trait cards are shuffled into your deck.

#### 4-5 player variant
If you are playing with 4 or 5 players (excluding the Game Master), instead start with the following:

- 1 x Understanding
- 1 x Devotion
- 1 x Pleasure
- 1 x Rest
- 1 x Resolve

Follow the remaining steps as usual.

# Game Master

You are the Game Master. In a world of unknown horrors seeking to change the very fabric of human existance, you are the secret agent pushing the world to the brink of catastrophy.

An Evil is the core to this. It drives the danger and is the cause for the entire event. Through the course of its actions and influences it will bring harm, corruption, destruction and suffering. The exact nature of it' plan will evolve as the story does but it never hurts to have some dastardly ideas in mind.


## Getting started as the Game Master

#### Step 1 Evil:

The Evil is the focus of the story. Stopping it for good will end the story. 

- Draw 1 x Evil card.
- Give it a name.
- Decide what it wants and what that means for the players or the world if it happened.
- Choose a weakness for the Evil so that the players can defeat it for good.

#### Step 2 Minions:

A minion is an individual or group that will assist the Evil. 

- Draw 1 x Minion card.
- Give the minion(s) a name.
- Think about why they are helping the Evil and how.

Repeat this step for additional minions. (optional)

#### Step 3 Bystanders:

A bystander that will help the characters in a variety of ways. It is important the players have allies as well as enemies.

- Draw 1 x Bystander card
- Give the bystander a name.
- Think about why they are helping the player's and how the Evil has effected them.

Repeat this step for additional bystanders. (optional)

#### Step 4 Locations:

A location is somewhere that is important to the Evil and/or the story.

- Draw 1 x Location card
- Give the location a name.
- This may be a lair or where something the Evil wants resides. It can even be it's own entity trying to stop the players.

Repeat this step for additional locations, this can be done any time the player's visit a new hostile location.

#### Step 5 Player Introductions:

- Get each player in turn to:
- Tell you their name.
- Use the prompts on their Background and Trait cards.

Then:
- Get all the players to collectively explain how they became a team of investigators.

As a Game Master you should attempt to integrate the player characters introductions into the story, changing locations, ideas and threats to tie them in whenever possible.

#### Step 6 Gameplay

You are ready to begin!

Below are some principles to follow as a Game Master,

- Set the scene, it's often good to give the players a direct hook such as a call to arms, or even put them right into the aftermath of the Evil's latest attack.
- Remember to ask the players "What do you do?"

#### Step 7 Epilogue

When the Evil is dealt with for good, or the characters have failed gameplay stops. As Game Master you should describe the immediate outcome and then ask each player to provide an epilogue for their character; alive or dead.
